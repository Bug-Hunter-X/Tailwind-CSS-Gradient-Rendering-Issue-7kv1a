# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Tailwind CSS gradient does not render correctly. The issue stems from potential version conflicts or misconfigurations within the Tailwind setup.

## Bug Description

A simple gradient applied using Tailwind's utility classes renders as a solid color instead of the expected smooth transition between colors. This indicates a problem with how Tailwind is processing or applying the gradient styles.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Node modules using `npm install`.
3. Run the application (instructions may vary based on your setup).
4. Observe the incorrect rendering of the gradient in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying your Tailwind CSS configuration and updating to the latest version if necessary.  Ensure there are no conflicting styles overriding the gradient properties.  The solution file (`bugSolution.js`) provides a corrected implementation.
